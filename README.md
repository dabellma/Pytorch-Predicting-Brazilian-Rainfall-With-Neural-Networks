This project's goal was to use distributed-pytorch to train neural network models to correlate greenhouse gas emissions and changes in rainfall patterns in Brazil.
Eventually we found that this would entail using time-based RNNs, and other state of the art methods of deep learning weather prediction, which was out of the scope of this class project.
So, we settled on predicting rainfalls for time ranges (ex: 2013-2015) based off of multiple features such as greenhouse gas levels, temperature levels, air radiation levels, and other data.
This was successful.
